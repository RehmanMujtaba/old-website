        		<h1>About Section</h1>
				<p>As said before, I am a first year CS student messing around with HTML5. Right now, 
			         I'm in my first co-op term working at a STEM summer camp right here in Waterloo. Over these few months, I hope to
                                 have time to work on other projects and document them on here. If I did that, you should see them in the blog section!<p>
