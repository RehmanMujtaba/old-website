        		<h1>About Section</h1>
				<p>I'm a second year student in the University of Waterloo Computer Science porgram! I am constantly looking for oppourtunities for
				   different projects that I find interesting. One of them is this webstie. It's not the most polished landing page, and thats mostly
			           becasuse the design was done entirly by me while I was first learning HTML/CSS. If I get time to do it again, which I hopefully will in
			           in the next few months, I plan for it to look very different<p>
				<p>Right now, I'm working on a Unix command line text editor that I am making in C. I plan to add a blog post documenting the process!
