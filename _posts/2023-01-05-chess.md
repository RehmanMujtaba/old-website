I have worked on one massive project along with several smaller ones.
I will update this website when I get a break from my coursework this term, likely around reading week.

For my OOP class, I colabrated on a group project with 2 other students to make a chess engine.
The entire project was made in C++, (technically Makefile excluded) and took over 3000 lines.

This https://github.com/mhzaman-cs/CS246 is a link to the private repository, which is private for academic integrity reasons.

I can still talk a bit about the project on here, but I have to be really careful. Which is unfortunate, as it's my largest project so far.
